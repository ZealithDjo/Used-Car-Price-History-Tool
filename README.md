# Used-Car-Price-History-Tool\n
Purpose:  
-Periodically gathers vehicle data from online car dealerships and displays the price history of a searched vehicle in the user GUI.  
-Wanted to experiment and learn more about web scraping, handle large amounts of data entries, develop my skills in Python, and learn to create GUIs.  
  
TODOs:  
-Automate the web scraping process  
-Add more scrapers for other websites  
-Possibly move away from saving data to csv files since they can grow to be very large  
-Improve/fix bugs in GUI
