# Used-Car-Price-History-Tool\n
Purpose:\n
Periodically gathers vehicle data from online car dealerships and displays the price history of a searched vehicle in the user GUI.\n
Wanted to experiment and learn more about web scraping, handle large amounts of data entries, develop my skills in Python, and learn to create GUIs.\n

TODOs:\n
Automate the web scraping process\n
Add more scrapers for other websites \n
Possibly move away from saving data to csv files since they can grow to be very large \n
Improve/fix bugs in GUI \n
